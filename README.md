# Coding challenge (finds pairs of integers from a list that sum to a given value)

In the next submit, you will find a src folder which contains main file and tests folder, in main file are two methods to find pairs on a list which sum is equals to the given value with different time complexities and in tests folder the test_main file with two methods to make testing using the find_pairs method. 

## Methods

### finds_pairs

This method has two parameters, the firsts is a list of integers without repeats numbers and the second is an integer that represents the sum of a pair of numbers in the list.

And return a tuples set with two numbers where their sum is equals to the given value in the second parameter.

This method has time complexity O(n).

### find_pairs_n2

This method has two parameters, the firsts is a list of integers without repeats numbers and the second is an integer that represents the sum of a pair of numbers in the list.

And return a tuples set with two numbers where their sum is equals to the given value in the second parameter.

This method has time complexity O(n^2).

## How to run the code

You can use the main.py file to run the code. Change the values of the list or number and test it!

Use these variables to make your test!

``your_sum_number: int = 0``

``your_number_list: list = [ ]``

And uncomment this code lines!

``# pairs: set = finds_pairs(your_number_list, your_sum_number)``

``# print(pairs)``

Then you would, run the code using VSC extensions or an IDE like PyCharm. Or using the terminal with the command: 

``py .\src\main.py`` on Windows

or 

``python3 ./src/main.py`` on Linux

## Thank you!
